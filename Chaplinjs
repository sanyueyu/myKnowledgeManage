1, By default, the compose method only allows for composing views.

2, If a view is composed in a controller action method it will be instantiated and rendered if the view has not been composed in the current or previous action methods.

If a view was composed in the previous action method and is not composed in the current action method, it will be disposed and removed from the DOM.
